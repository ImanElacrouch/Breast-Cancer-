# Breast_Cancer

Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer among women, with alarming statistics in Morocco. Due to its high incidence and devastating impact, implementing effective early detection and diagnosis strategies is crucial. This project focuses on the automated detection of breast cancer using mammogram images, employing advanced image processing and deep learning techniques. 

The data used are medical images in DICOM format, a standard for storing and transmitting medical images. These images undergo rigorous preprocessing to ensure quality and consistency. The preprocessing steps include image normalization and the application of filters to enhance relevant details.

Three convolutional neural network (CNN) models were used: basic CNN, VGG (Visual Geometry Group), and GoogLeNet. Each model was trained and tested on the preprocessed images, with special attention to hyperparameter optimization and preventing overfitting. 

The models were evaluated in terms of accuracy, loss, and ROC curves. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions, while loss evaluates the overall error of the model. ROC curves visualize the models' performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity. These metrics were compared to determine the most effective model.

The goal is to improve screening and diagnostic practices, contributing to earlier treatment and better patient survival rates.
